# Plot and TensorBoard

## Introduction

In the previous tutorial, we learned about **model** and **Transfer Learning**.
As you might recall, when we were training our model using `.fit` function, we were storing its result in a variable
called `history`.
In this tutorial, we will learn more about `history` and how to plot its results.
Also, we will learn about a very powerful tool for plotting and seeing the results during training,
called **TensorBoard**.
