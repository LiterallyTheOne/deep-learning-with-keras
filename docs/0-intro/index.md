# Introduction

## Keras

**Keras** is a high-level API for building and training **Deep Learning Models**.
It is designed to be a stand-alone project.
But with the help of **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **Jax**,
It can run on top of different hardware (e.g., **CPU**, **GPU**).

The fascinating thing about **Keras** is that it is super easy to get started with.
You can train and test a model with only a few lines of code.
It is a perfect way to learn **Deep Learning** concepts by practically seeing their effects.
