# Fine-tuning

## Introduction

In the previous tutorials, we learned about transfer learning and how to use the advantage of
a pre-trained model on our dataset.
In this Tutorial, we learn about how to apply fine-tuning and see the results.
Also, we introduce how to use other platforms like [Kaggle models](https://www.kaggle.com/models/)
to access to new models.
