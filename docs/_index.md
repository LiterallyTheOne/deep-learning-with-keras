# Deep learning with Keras Tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to discus about the most important aspects of
**Deep Learning** with the help of a great package called **Keras**.
**Keras** is one of the best **Python** packages that you can use to enter
the world of **Deep learning**.
We start with a simple example, and then we are going to expand it little by little,
until it becomes a good practical project.
We also use **Kaggle** to download datasets and pretrained models.
